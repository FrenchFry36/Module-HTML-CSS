        <h2 class="section-h2">Introduction to Git</h2>
        <p class="section-p">Git is an essential tool for modern software development, offering powerful features for version control, collaboration, and branching. It allows developers to track changes, manage multiple versions of code through branching, and integrate work efficiently with features like merging and pull requests. Popular Git platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket enhance Git’s core capabilities by providing additional tools for project management and CI/CD pipelines. Understanding Git’s concepts, such as repositories, commits, branches, and staging, is crucial for mastering collaborative development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-h2">Why Developers Need Git?</h2>
          <p class="section-p">Git is an essential tool for modern software development, enabling developers to collaborate efficiently, manage code versions, and track project changes. As a distributed version control system (VCS), Git allows multiple team members to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. Developers can 
          commit changes locally and push them to a shared repository, making it easier to review, merge, or roll back updates.

          <h2 class="section-h2">What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p class="section-p">In Git, a branch is essentially a pointer to a specific series of commits, representing an independent line of development. Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously without affecting the main or production codebase.</p>
